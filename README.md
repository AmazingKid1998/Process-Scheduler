# 🖥️ Process Scheduler (FCFS • RR • SJF • SRTF)

Interactive, educational CPU scheduling visualizer built with **React (JavaScript)** and **SVG**.  
Simulate **FCFS**, **Round Robin**, **SJF (non-preemptive)**, and **SRTF (preemptive SJF)**.  
Visualize process scheduling with a Gantt chart, tweak quantum values, import/export CSV, and analyze metrics.
